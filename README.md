# Project Overview: WashHandsOVR – VR Hand Hygiene Simulator
WashHandsOVR is a Virtual Reality (VR) hand hygiene training application developed as part of my Honours project at the University of the Free State. The application is designed to provide nursing students with an immersive and interactive learning experience, simulating real-world healthcare environments to teach and assess proper hand hygiene techniques.

The project addresses the critical need for effective hand hygiene training in healthcare settings, where healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose significant risks. By offering students a virtual environment where they can practice hand hygiene according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, WashHandsOVR aims to improve hand hygiene compliance and skills among nursing students.

## Key Features:
**Immersive VR Environment:** The application uses Unity and the Oculus Quest VR headset to simulate a hospital environment where students can practice handwashing techniques.
**Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Through the Oculus Interaction SDK, the application provides real-time tracking of hand movements, ensuring accurate simulation of handwashing steps.
**WHO Guidelines:** The simulator adheres to WHO’s guidelines for proper hand hygiene, ensuring that students are trained using globally recognized best practices.
**Interactive Feedback System:** Students receive immediate feedback on their hand hygiene performance, with metrics such as accuracy, technique, and time taken.
**Step-by-Step Guidance:** The application includes detailed instructions and visual aids to guide students through the handwashing process, ensuring they understand each step.

## Technologies Used:
**Unity:** Core development engine for building the VR environment.
**C#:** Used for scripting and interaction logic in Unity.
**Oculus Quest**: The primary hardware platform for delivering the immersive experience.
**Oculus Interaction SDK:** For hand tracking and interaction with virtual objects.
**Microsoft Visual Studio:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding and debugging.

## Project Goals:
Provide an interactive and realistic simulation for nursing students to practice hand hygiene techniques.
Deliver real-time feedback to improve learning and ensure adherence to WHO guidelines.
Create a scalable and reusable VR platform that can be further expanded for other healthcare-related simulations.
